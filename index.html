Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus).

It is categorized as red meat — a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish.

Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers.

Processed beef products include corned beef, beef jerky, and sausages.

Fresh, lean beef is rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc. Therefore, moderate intake of beef can be recommended as part of a healthy diet.</p>

     <p class="text_style"> 
      Although sometimes considered a vegetable, mushrooms are a type of fungus. In a way, mushrooms are like the fruit of a plant. Instead of producing seeds, the mushroom fungus releases millions of microscopic spores that form under the mushroom’s cap. They can grow above ground, on top of the soil, or on the surface of a food source.

Mushrooms are native to North America and Europe and are known for their delicate flavor and meaty texture.

They are also widely known for their amazing health benefits. Packed with a ton of essential vitamins and minerals, mushrooms make for an excellent addition to your diet, adding a great taste to many different recipes.
